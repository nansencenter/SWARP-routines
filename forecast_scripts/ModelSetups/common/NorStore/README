# Backup scripts to handle daily .tar.gz forecast files running at hexagon
# For Norstore tape commands see:
# https://www.norstore.no/services/tape-storage
#
# NOTE! All scripts use the general format for forecasts as:
# HYCOMreg=$1 Regional model setup tex: TP4a0.12
# FCtype=$2   Forecast type tex: ice_only or wavesice_ww3arctic or ...
# Then general info for this forecast os sourced from:
# source $modset/$HYCOMreg/$FCtype/inputs/THISFC.src
# 
# Several scripts have a optional input ($3) of date (if not current date is assumed)

# Backup SWARP forecast from /project/ to /tape area once a week
# Run on Sundays, check all dates for the week, if not send error message
# Untar all files and make a new "weekly" tar file
# ASSUME input file type as:
#  SWARP${FC_OUTPUT}_${idate}.tar.gz (SWARPiceonly_forecast_20150101.tar.gz)
#  WriteToTape <filename> <projectname> [<relative_path_on_tape>] [--replicate]
# INPUT
# $1 HYCOMreg read in expt HYCOM region, to sort and get right paths 
# $2 forecast version, same as folder name, text "ice_only" or "wavesice_ww3arctic"
# $3 date (YYYYMMDD) - if not input, the current date is assumed
# OUTPUT
# save files to NorStore tape, file name of first day in week
# outfile=YYYYMMDD_weekly.tar.gz
# write weekly text file in $path1/WriteToTape_list, list of existing daily files
# write weekly text file in $path1/NOT_WriteToTape_list, list of NOT existing daily files
# TODO do we need a replicate of the backup on a different tape??

## week nesting tar files are saved on tuesdays and copied to Norstore from Hexiagon
##Use Norstore backup commands:
