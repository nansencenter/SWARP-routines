# TO BE FILLED WITH ALL PACKAGES

\section{22.05.2015}
Today I'm going to work on the validation system. Specifically the first step needed in this process is to reproject the product of WIMSI on OSI-SAF grid. \\
For now I was not lucky, after trying with the Nansat python package I finally gave up and will be trying to manually cut the ncfiles. The NetCDF package for BASH
should do the trick even if I'm not sure how I can confirm that the two files are perfectly allined. After the cut the next step will be an interpolation by using
Python, specifically the interpolate.griddata package which I'm studying right now. \\ \\
Personal side-note, this process has to be faster since I haven't written a single page of my thesis and given my scarce ability as a writer I think is going to take
its time. Better hurry.
